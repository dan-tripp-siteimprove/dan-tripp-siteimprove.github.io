<p>Canned response: <blockquote>
I believe that this Siteimprove rule is working as intended.  There is an outer < ul > element and an inner < ul > element here.  The outer < ul > element has no direct < li > children, so it is seen as "empty" for the purposes of this accessibilty rule.  ("Empty" here means "no children according to the ARIA specification" - not "no content at all".)  One way that you could fix this would be: remove the outer < ul > element.  Or change it to a < div > element.  (This might cause a change in the visual appearance, so you might need to adjust the CSS to compensate.)
