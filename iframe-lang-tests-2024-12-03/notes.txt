- findings, 2024-12-03:
	- screen reader 
		- https://dan-tripp-siteimprove.github.io/iframe-lang-tests-2024-12-03/parent-for-screen-reader-tests.html 
		- we found no way to get the screen reader to announce the iframe title (/ acc name) in spanish. 
			- this happened even when the parent's <html> element was lang=es.  we find this strange. 
			- we tried title, aria-label, aria-labelledby 
		- <iframe lang="es"> had no effect.  i.e. did not change screen reader's pronounciation, of either the iframe title or the iframe content.
		- in child: <html lang="es"> and <span lang="es"> worked. 
		- when parent has lang=es and child has nothing, lang=es was not inherited.  
		- tested NVDA only.  not jaws or anything else.
		- results were the same in chrome and firefox, for all of the above points. 
	- translation 
		- https://dan-tripp-siteimprove.github.io/iframe-lang-tests-2024-12-03/parent-for-translation-tests.html 
		- iframe child not translated by either chrome nor firefox.
