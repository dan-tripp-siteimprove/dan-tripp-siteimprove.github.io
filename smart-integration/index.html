<h1>SMART browser extension</h1>

<h2>Instructions</h2>

<h3>One-time installation</h3>

Hopefully you'll only need to do these steps once.

<ul>
<li>Open Chrome </li>
<li>Go to chrome://extensions/ </li>
<li>Find the "developer mode" toggle.  (It's in the upper right corner, at the time of writing.)  Enable this toggle. </li>
</ul>


<h3>Installation: on every new version </h3>

Follow these steps the first time you install this browser extension, and also every time you want to update to a new version of it.  (This browser extension unfortunately does not update itself.)

<ul>
<li>Download the zip file </li>
<li>
Extract it to somewhere.  For example, to a folder named C:\Users\YOUR_NAME\smart-browser-extension-v1.2
	<ul>
		<li>If you already have an old version extracted to somewhere, don't try to overwrite it.  That would make a mess.  Extract to a new folder every time.
		</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>In Chrome, go to the chrome://extensions/ page. </li>
<li>Press the "load unpacked" button </li>
<li>Select the folder that you extracted the extension to (for example: C:\Users\YOUR_NAME\smart-browser-extension-v1.2).  Press "Ok" or whatever the case may be. </li>
<li>Now you have two versions of the extension installed: the old one and the new one.  You can leave both installed, if you want.  But most people will probably want to remove the old one.
	<ul>
		<li>From the chrome://extensions/ page, find the old version of the extension.  You'll see the version number in the name: "SMART browser extension 0.2" or whatever the case may be.  Click the "Remove" button to uninstall it.
			<ul>
				<li>Or, if you only want to temporarily disable it, there is a toggle button for that.  This part is not user-friendly.  This toggle is not visually labelled.  At the time of writing, it's visually at the bottom-right.  The accessible name of it in the enabled state is "On, extension enabled" and in the disabled state is "Off".</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Sorry for the trouble.  If I figure out how to make the extension update automatically, I'll do it.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>
Now a button for this extension (i.e. the new version) exists in Chrome, in the toolbar, near your bookmarks.   It might be buried under the "Extensions" button/menu.
	<ul>
		<li>If you want to pin the SMART extension to the toolbar (so that it's always visible and easy to reach): 
		From chrome://extensions/ , find the SMART browser extension, press the "Details" button, find the "Pin to toolbar" toggle.  Enable it. </li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ul>
		
<h3>To run it</h3>
<ul>
<li>Press the SMART browser extension's button (in the toolbar, near your bookmarks.)  A new window will appear which contains the results.
<ul>
<li>The keyboard accessibility of this Chrome toolbar is unclear to me.  These keyboard shortcuts might help: F10, and alt+shift+t.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To re-run the extension, you can press the SMART browser extension's button again twice (once to close it, once to re-open it).  Or use the "Refresh" button inside of its window.</li>
</li>
</ul>
