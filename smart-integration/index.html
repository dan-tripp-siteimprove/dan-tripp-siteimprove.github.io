<h1>SMART browser extension</h1>


<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>You can install this browser extension in one of two ways: from the Chrome Web Store, or from a zip file.</p>




<h2>Release Notes</h2>

<ul>
	<li>
		Version 0.5 (2024-04-12)
		<ul>
			<li>
				 Label in name: now showing multiple text areas.  Not just one.
			</li>
			<li>
				 New icon.  Now looks different from the main Siteimprove browser extension.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		Version 0.4
		<ul>
			<li>
				 New: "label in name".
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		Version 0.3
	</li>
	<li>
		Version 0.2
	</li>
	<li>
		Version 0.1
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Chrome Web Store: Installation Instructions</h2>

<ul>
	<li>
		Install it from the <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/smart-browser-extension/cbjpifmhflpconoldedpmohfbnlflkih">Chrome web store listing</a>.  It's "unlisted", so it won't show up in search results.  It's installable to anyone who has the link.
	</li>
	<li>
	If you want to pin the SMART extension to the toolbar (so that it's always visible and easy to reach): From chrome://extensions/ , find the SMART browser extension, press the "Details" button, and find the "Pin to toolbar" toggle.  Enable it.
	</li>
	<li>
		Every time I release a new version, your copy of the extension will update to it automatically.  This is the big advantage of the web store over zip files.  The update usually happens within a day, I think.
	</li>
	
</ul>

</ul>


<h2>Zip Files: Installation Instructions</h2>

<h3>One-time installation</h3>

Hopefully you'll only need to do these steps once.

<ul>
<li>Open Chrome </li>
<li>Go to chrome://extensions/ </li>
<li>Find the "developer mode" toggle.  (It's in the upper right corner, at the time of writing.)  Enable this toggle. </li>
</ul>


<h3>Installation: on every new version </h3>

Follow these steps the first time you install this browser extension, and also every time you want to update to a new version of it.  If you installed from a zip file, then this browser extension will not update itself.  This is the big disadvantage of zip files, comapred to the web store.

<ul>
<li>Download one of the zip files from the <a href="#h_downloads">"Downloads" section of this page</a>.</li>
<li>
Extract it to somewhere.  For example, to a folder named C:\Users\YOUR_NAME\smart-browser-extension-v1.2
	<ul>
		<li>If you already have an old version extracted to somewhere, don't try to overwrite it.  That would make a mess.  So extract to a new folder every time.
		</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>In Chrome, go to the chrome://extensions/ page. </li>
<li>Press the "load unpacked" button </li>
<li>Select the folder that you extracted the extension to (for example: C:\Users\YOUR_NAME\smart-browser-extension-v1.2).  Press "Ok" or whatever the case may be. </li>
<li>If this is not your first time doing this: now you have two versions of the extension installed: the old one and the new one.  You can leave both installed, if you want.  But most people will probably want to remove the old one.
	<ul>
		<li>From the chrome://extensions/ page, find the old version of the extension.  You'll see the version number in the name: "SMART browser extension 0.2" or whatever the case may be.  Click the "Remove" button to uninstall it.
			<ul>
				<li>Or, if you only want to temporarily disable it, there is a toggle button for that.  This part is not user-friendly.  This toggle is not visually labelled.  At the time of writing, it's visually at the bottom-right.  The accessible name of it in the enabled state is "On, extension enabled" and in the disabled state is "Off".</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Sorry for the trouble.  If I figure out how to make the extension update automatically, I'll do it.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>
If you want to pin the SMART extension to the toolbar (so that it's always visible and easy to reach): From chrome://extensions/ , find the SMART browser extension, press the "Details" button, find the "Pin to toolbar" toggle.  Enable it.
</li>
</ul>
		
<h2>Usage Instructions</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Press the SMART browser extension's button (in the toolbar, near your bookmarks.)  A new window will appear which contains the results.
		<ul>
			<li>The keyboard accessibility of this Chrome toolbar is unclear to me.  These keyboard shortcuts might help: F10, and alt+shift+t.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>To re-run the extension, you can press the SMART browser extension's button again twice (once to close it, once to re-open it).  Or use the "Refresh" button inside of its window.
</li>
</ul>
