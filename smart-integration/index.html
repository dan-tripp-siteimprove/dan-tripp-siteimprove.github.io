	<li>
		Version 0.15 (2026-02-02)
		<ul>
			<li>Adding the "lists" bookmarlet.
			<li>All bookmarklets: now supporting shadow dom and iframes, the nesting of them, more generally.  eg. a shadow dom containing an iframe containing a shadow dom containing an iframe.  Still not supported: cross-origin iframes and closed shadow dom.
		</ul>
	</li>

	<li>
		Version 0.14 (2026-01-21) 
		<ul>
			<li>Focus bookmarklet: new checkbox: "Show XPath".
			<li>Focus bookmarklet: drawing lines and arrows between the flags.
			<li>Focus bookmarklet. new feature: user-configurable menu dock position (top/middle/bottom).  Before this, it was always "top".
			<li>Focus bookmarklet: new feature: user-configurable flag directions: north/south/east/west.  Before this, it was always north.
		</ul>
	</li>

	<li>
		Version 0.13 (2026-01-08)
		<ul>
			<li>Each bookmarklet now has a documentation link next to it.
			<li>Focus bookmarklet: bug fix for this bookmarklet's floating menu sometimes showing strange fonts or text shadows, on certain pages.  This was happening because the page's CSS would sometimes affect our bookmarklet's floating menu.  This bug still exists for our Target Size bookmarklet.
			<li>Focus bookmarklet: bug fix regarding when focus is inside this bookmarklet's floating menu.  
			<li>Focus bookmarklet: bug fix regarding the "focus trail" flags and alt-tabbing to another window. 
			<li>ARIA bookmarklet and Images bookmarklet: bug fix regarding elements with "display: none" and "visibility: hidden".  Now we don't "decorate" such elements.  We used to, sometimes.
			<li>The beta channel has a new icon. 
		</ul>
	</li>

	<li>
		Version 0.12 (2025-12-19)
		<ul>
			<li>Headings bookmarklet: now handles recursive shadow dom and recursive iframes.
			<li>All bookmarklets: bookmarklets no longer decorate other bookmarklets' stuff (eg. the ARIA bookmarklet decorating the Focus bookmarklet's floating menu).
			<li>The expandable sections (AKA details/summary) for "Boomarklets" and "SMART checks": their expanded/collapsed state is now remembered.
			<li>Adding the "Copy scrape to clipboard" button.   The scrape is no longer copied to the clipboard automatically (on every refresh) any more.  it's only copied when you click the button.
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		Version 0.11 (2025-12-16)
		<ul>
			<li>Bookmarklets are now in here.  Only the ones that were in the "mt-tools" project before: lang, focus, target size, aria, headings, images.
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		Version 0.10 (2025-12-10)
		<ul>
			<li>Multi-occurrence snippet formatting: putting each "thing" in it's own listitem.  "Thing" could be an href, img src, and so on.  From <a href="https://siteimprove.slack.com/archives/C04E7PPJV9U/p1759156332471369">this slack thread from Sept 2025</a>.
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		Version 0.9 (2025-12-08)
		<ul>
			<li>This release might have no user-visible changes.  Internally, it's a significant reorganization: I merged the last year of changes in the upstream project into this project.  The upstream project had a lot of changes in terms of package management. 
			<li>Now using Alfa version 0.103.3.  It's unclear what the consequences of this are for this project, if any.
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		Version 0.8 
		<ul>
			<li>(Uploaded zip file to this page: 2024-09-13.  Uploaded to Chrome Web Store: 2024-09-20.)</li>
			<li>New icon from Jeremy.</li>
			<li>Added "Highlight occurrence on page" button.</li>
			<li>Added "Multiple-occurrence snippet" and "Single-occurrence snippets".
				<ul>
					<li>Before this, some test cases had effectively a "multiple-occurrence snippet" only, and other test cases had effectively "single-occurrence snippets" only.</li>
					<li>Added to each single-occurrence snippet: a checkbox to "Include this occurrence in the multi-occurrence snippet".</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Now using Alfa version 0.88.0.  Many consequent minor changes.</li>
			<li>Handling 200% zoom better.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		Version 0.7 (2024-05-02)
		<ul>
			<li>Label in Name: Now reporting more failures, such as the "View all" button on https://www.bang-olufsen.com/en/us/soundbars.  This change also causes more false positives on other pages.  I think they're worth it.  Let me know.
			</li>
			<li>Label in Name: Now in the output, newlines (which are in the visible label) no longer appear.
			</li>
			<li>Rearranging the visual/reading order of the test cases in match SMART (eg. SC 2.4.4 comes before SC 1.1.1.) 
			</li>
			<li>Moving each "copy to clipboard" button to after the corresponding text area.
			</li>
			<li>Obscure bug fix: whole window would fail to refresh sometimes if you moved focus away from the browser immediately after doing a refresh.  This bug would happen more on big slow pages.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		Version 0.6 (2024-04-24)
		<ul>
			<li>Label in name: bug fix.  Bug affected certin pages such as https://www.virginplus.ca/en/support/index.html?topic=dual_sim.  The bug was: the SMART browser extension would show no results.  Just an empty window.  In the console (the extension's console, not the page's console), this error message would appear:    <code>ReferenceError: and is not defined</code>.
			</li>
			<li>Moving preamble about number of elements checked out of the "copy-and-paste" text areas.  
			</li>
			<li>Wording changes as per 2024-04-12 and 2024-04-19 meetings with team.  Incl. spelling out numbers less than 10. Incl. new remediation advice for the "image alt text" test case and the "link has accessible name" test case.  Including, for the 'link new tab' rule: "The following six links open in a new window without informing users beforehand".
			</li>
			<li>Label in name: now truncating very long visible labels in our output.  (> 250 chars.) 
			</li>
			<li>Adding more backticks (markdown to show as "code") to output, in a few places. 
			</li>
			<li>No href?  Now outputting "(Empty)".  (Was previously: "undefined" or "".)
			</li>
			<li>Not fixed yet: 'label in name' bug on https://www.bang-olufsen.com/en/us/soundbars, where it misses the error on the 'View all' link. 
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		Version 0.5 (2024-04-12)
		<ul>
			<li>
				 Label in name: now showing multiple text areas.  Not just one.
			</li>
			<li>
				 New icon.  Now looks different from the main Siteimprove browser extension.
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		Version 0.4
		<ul>
			<li>
				 New: "label in name".
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		Version 0.3
	</li>
	<li>
		Version 0.2
	</li>
	<li>
		Version 0.1
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Chrome Web Store: Installation Instructions</h2>

<ul>
	<li>
		Install it from the <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/smart-browser-extension/cbjpifmhflpconoldedpmohfbnlflkih">Chrome web store listing</a>.  It's "unlisted", so it won't show up in search results.  It's installable to anyone who has the link.
	</li>
	<li>
	If you want to pin the SMART extension to the toolbar (so that it's always visible and easy to reach): From chrome://extensions/ , find the SMART browser extension, press the "Details" button, and find the "Pin to toolbar" toggle.  Enable it.
	</li>
	<li>
		Every time I release a new version, your copy of the extension will update to it automatically.  This is the big advantage of the web store over zip files.  The update usually happens within a day, I think.
	</li>
	
</ul>

<h2>Zip Files: Installation Instructions</h2>

<h3>One-time installation</h3>

Hopefully you'll only need to do these steps once.

<ul>
<li>Open Chrome </li>
<li>Go to chrome://extensions/ </li>
<li>Find the "developer mode" toggle.  (It's in the upper right corner, at the time of writing.)  Enable this toggle. </li>
</ul>


<h3>Installation: on every new version </h3>

Follow these steps the first time you install this browser extension, and also every time you want to update to a new version of it.  If you installed from a zip file, then this browser extension will not update itself.  This is the big disadvantage of zip files, comapred to the web store.

<ul>
<li>Download one of the zip files from the <a href="#h_downloads">"Downloads" section of this page</a>.</li>
<li>
Extract it to somewhere.  For example, to a folder named C:\Users\YOUR_NAME\smart-browser-extension-v1.2
	<ul>
		<li>If you already have an old version extracted to somewhere, don't try to overwrite it.  That would make a mess.  So extract to a new folder every time.
		</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>In Chrome, go to the chrome://extensions/ page. </li>
<li>Press the "load unpacked" button </li>
<li>Select the folder that you extracted the extension to (for example: C:\Users\YOUR_NAME\smart-browser-extension-v1.2).  Press "Ok" or whatever the case may be. </li>
<li>If this is not your first time doing this: now you have two versions of the extension installed: the old one and the new one.  You can leave both installed, if you want.  But most people will probably want to remove the old one.
	<ul>
		<li>From the chrome://extensions/ page, find the old version of the extension.  You'll see the version number in the name: "SMART browser extension 0.2" or whatever the case may be.  Click the "Remove" button to uninstall it.
			<ul>
				<li>Or, if you only want to temporarily disable it, there is a toggle button for that.  This part is not user-friendly.  This toggle is not visually labelled.  At the time of writing, it's visually at the bottom-right.  The accessible name of it in the enabled state is "On, extension enabled" and in the disabled state is "Off".</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Sorry for the trouble.  If I figure out how to make the extension update automatically, I'll do it.</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>
If you want to pin the SMART extension to the toolbar (so that it's always visible and easy to reach): From chrome://extensions/ , find the SMART browser extension, press the "Details" button, find the "Pin to toolbar" toggle.  Enable it.
</li>
</ul>
		
<h2>Usage Instructions</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Press the SMART browser extension's button (in the toolbar, near your bookmarks.)  A new window will appear which contains the results.
		<ul>
			<li>The keyboard accessibility of this Chrome toolbar is unclear to me.  These keyboard shortcuts might help: F10, and alt+shift+t.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>To re-run the extension, you can press the SMART browser extension's button again twice (once to close it, once to re-open it).  Or use the "Refresh" button inside of its window.
</li>
</ul>
