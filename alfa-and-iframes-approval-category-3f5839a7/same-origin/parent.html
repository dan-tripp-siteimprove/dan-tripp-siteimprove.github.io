<li>... b/c you don't want to run this test on a file:// URL, b/c I don't understand the implications of that with regard to iframe origins and alfa, and even if I did, I wouldn't know how to make different "same-origin" and "cross-origin" cases w/ file://.
<li>... b/c you don't want to run this test from github pages on the internet, b/c this page uses my localhost aliases in my machine's "hosts" file.
