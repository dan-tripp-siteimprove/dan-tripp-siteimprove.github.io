I tested this page on iOS Voice Control on 2025-10-08.  Results were strange and not what the article seemed to predict.  I spoke "tap email" and that worked, sortof: it showed two numbers: a "1" on the label, and a "2" on the text field.  Then whether I spoke "1" or "2" it focused the text field.  So I consider that to work, but with an extra step.   The article says it plain doesn't work.  Also the other cases on this worked the same way - so the "just wrapping" case was no worse. 

Note the comments on the article.  i.e. this might be fixed.
