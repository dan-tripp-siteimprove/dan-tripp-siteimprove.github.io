	This paragraph simulates the customer's page.

This paragraph uses ":where" and ":not". As of 2023-08-04, ":where" isn't supported by alfa.  So this link will be incorrectly failed by alfa.  It's a false positive.

	This paragraph does not use ":where" and does use ":not".  As of 2023-08-04, ":not" is supported by alfa.  So this paragraph works.  It's not flagged by alfa.  It's not a false positive.  It's a true negative.  This paragraph can serve as a demo for how the customer can change their page so that alfa will recognize it, and they don't need to rely on the false positives process.<br>
