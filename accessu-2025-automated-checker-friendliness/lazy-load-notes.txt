
<img loading="lazy"> 

	- I verified via devtools network tab that lazy-loading is working.   
		- important: set the height on the img. 

	- surprising results here w/ nvda (on chrome) 
		- either loading="lazy" or adding <img> via JS was often enough to get that image unannounced. 
		- unannounced means: no mention on arrow nav, and on g "no next graphic". 
		- the text content was announced fine.
