
<img loading="lazy"> 

	- I verified via devtools network tab that lazy-loading is working.   
		- important: set the height on the img. 

	- surprising results here w/ nvda (on chrome) 
		- either loading="lazy" or adding <img> via JS was often enough to get that image unannounced. 
		- unannounced means: no mention on arrow nav, and on g "no next graphic". 
		- the text content was announced fine. 
		
	- voiceover 
		- uninteresting.  I couldn't produce any strangeness, or even figure out how to emulate the behaviours in nvda that caused strangeness in nvda. 

<iframe loading="lazy"> 

	- don't load from a file:// URL.  if you do, the iframe lazy loading won't work.  
	
	- nvda
	
		- with these iframes I got straightforward lazy load problem: at top of page, ins+f7 showed only the first ~ 6 links.   

		- with these iframes I couldn't reproduce the mysterious kinds of problems that I had w/ <img loading="lazy">.  
			- w/ nvda on chrome 
				- I arrowed down through the whole page and all images got announced.  all links got announced.  viewport didn't scroll down.  and ins+f7 showed all the links.
