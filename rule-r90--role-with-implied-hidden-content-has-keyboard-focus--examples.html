<li>
	The <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/act/rules/307n5z/#test-cases">test cases for the corresponding ACT rule</a> are good.
</li>


<li>
	Fails: <button>&lt;button&gt; which contains an <a href="#">anchor</a></button><br>
	This is also invalid HTML.  <a href="https://validator.w3.org/">Nu checker</a> says: "Error: The element a must not appear as a descendant of the button element."<br>
</li>

<li>
	Passes (to my surprise): <a href="#">anchor which contains a <button>&lt;button&gt;</button></a><br>
	This is invalid HTML.  <a href="https://validator.w3.org/">Nu checker</a> says: "Error: The element button must not appear as a descendant of the a element."<br>
	Passes the <a href="https://alfa.siteimprove.com/rules/sia-r90">R90 rule</a> on a technicality?  It's because of the corresponding <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/act/rules/307n5z/">ACT rule (307n5z)</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#childrenArePresentational">ARIA spec</a>.  (I don't know why ACT and ARIA are written this way, but they are.)  The ACT rule refers to the ARIA spec, and checks (for the outer element) any roles which have 'children presentational' = true.  This includes "button", "checkbox", etc. - and not "link".  So any time there's an anchor as the <i>outer</i> element, that will pass R90.  (An anchor as the <i>inner</i> element can still fail R90.) 
</li>


<li>
	... so this passes the rule too: <a href="#">anchor which contains <span tabindex="0" style="outline: dashed">all</span> kinds of <input type="checkbox" checked aria-label="checkbox1"> focusable <select aria-label="select1"><option value="opt1">content</option></select> </a> (some of which is invalid HTML) <br>
</li>

<li>
Fails: 
	<br>
	<ul role="tablist" >
	<li role="tab">This is a role="tab" element which contains an anchor element.  
	<a href="#">(and this is the anchor element)</a>   (It's non-functional tab element, by the way.  It doesn't really implement tabs.  That would require some javascript.)

	</ul>	

</li>



<li>
	Failure is impossible with an &lt;img&gt; element because &lt;img&gt; has no closing tag, so it's impossible to put anything inside of it. 
</li>

<li>
	... but this fails (a role="img" element):<br>
	<span role="img" aria-label="some ASCII art">****** This ASCII art ******* <a href="#">contains a link.</a></span>
</li>

<li>
	(Similar to &lt;img&gt;.) Failure is impossible with a "&lt;button&gt; element within a button &lt;button&gt; element".  Even though &lt;button&gt; has a closing tag (unlike &lt;img&gt;), the HTML parsing ignores the second starting &lt;button&gt; tag.  <a href="https://validator.w3.org/">Nu checker</a> says: "Error: Start tag button seen but an element of the same type was already open." and then "Error: Stray end tag button."  So it doesn't even get parsed as a "&lt;button&gt; element within a button &lt;button&gt; element".  It gets parsed as one button, then another button.  See this <a href="rule-r90--role-with-implied-hidden-content-has-keyboard-focus--button-element-within-a-button-element.html">button parse failure example</a>.  
</li>

<li>
	.. but with role="button" you can easily pass <i>basic</i> HTML parsing (in terms of start and end tags) and fail the R90 rule:<br>
	<button><div role="button" tabindex="0">This fails.  It's a &lt;div role="button" tabindex="0"&gt; within a &lt;button&gt;</div></button><br>
	<div role="button"><button>This fails.  It's a &lt;button&gt; within a &lt;div role="button"&gt;.  (No explicit tabindex anywhere.)</button></div>
	<button><div role="button">This passes.  It's a &lt;div role="button"&gt; within a &lt;button&gt; and has no tabindex attribute.  It passes because the inner element isn't focusable.</div></button><br>
</li>

<li>
	Fails: (this &lt;button&gt; contains a focusable &lt;span&gt;) <button>x<span tabindex="0">y</span></button> 
</li>

<li>
	Fails: <div role="button"><a href="foo">this is an anchor within a &lt;div role="button"&gt;</a></div>
</li>

<li>
	anchor without an href (like <a href="https://my2.siteimprove.com/Inspector/335344/A11Y/Page?pageId=59707193743&impmd=WQKEXZTLXHMSWPIINJCB&decision=dismissed+falsePositive+none#/sia-r90/failed/bnhJU3lrMWg=;YjQxMDk4ZjU=">this page report</a>):   

	<ul>
		<li>
			It's complicated.  See <a href="https://siteimprove-wgs.atlassian.net/browse/DEV-14325">this JIRA issue</a>.  
		</li>
		<li>
			In summary: an anchor without an href is not focusable and so it will pass the rule.  The above page report shows an anchor without an href, so one would think that it would pass the rule.  But it fails.  The reason: it's not really without an href.  It has href="javascript:void(0)", which is focusable, so it rightly fails the rule.  The HTML in the page report shows no href instead of href="javascript:void(0)" - reason is unknown.    There are other factors at work here (mentioned in the JIRA issue) but that's the important part, I think.  
		</li>
		<li>
			Example (passes the rule): <button><a>this is an anchor without an href inside of a button.</a></button>
		</li>
		<li>
			Example (fails the rule): <button><a href="#">this is an anchor with href="#" inside of a button.</a></button>
		</li>
		<li>
			Example (fails the rule): <button><a href="javascript:void(0)">this is an anchor with  href="javascript:void(0)" inside of a button.</a></button>

	aria-hidden="true"  case: <a aria-hidden="true" href="#">This passes R90 but fails R17 "Hidden element has focusable content".  (The a11y tree might show this link even though it has aria-hidden="true" on it.  I think that's the browser trying to fix this bad HTML.)</a> <br>
	This shows why (in my opinion) the platform shouldn't use the word "hidden" for R90.  It's confusing.  In R90, 'hidden' seems to mean 'hidden semantics, exposed text content' (which is what role="none" does.)  In R17, 'hidden' means 'hidden entirely' (which is what aria-hidden="true" does.)  I think that for R90, the platform should use the word 'presentational' everywhere instead of 'hidden'.   (Currently it uses 'presentational' and 'hidden' interchangeably.)
